Man, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness, and I gotta say, my brain’s still buzzing a bit. This  , it’s like getting lost in some emotional labyrinth, seriously. It starts one way, and then bam! You get slammed by this wave of feels you didn’t even see coming. You know what I mean? Like, whoa, didn’t expect to choke up over a simple line like “love has no boundaries.” Come on, melodrama alert! 

Anyway, there’s this scene... oh man, wait, spoiler alert? Yeah, maybe not, but let’s just say it got me thinking, like, do I even know how to love? Cheesy AF, right? I dunno,  s like these just have me questioning my life choices. But it's so relatable. Like, they had to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   itself to even get what they’re feeling across, if that makes sense.

> But hey, the visuals were on point. I don't usually get into that stuff, but yeah, gotta hand it to them. There was this one scene with the crazy lights and shadows, like a metaphor made flesh. It's like I could lose myself in those shades alone! And the soundtrack, don't even get me started. The music just wraps around the whole theme of love and darkness like a well-coded script, syncing everything perfectly together. Like, almost. 

For real though, there were moments I was like, ugh, come on, why is everyone suddenly having an epiphany at the same time? Does that even happen in real life? Maybe they had too much coffee on set or something. Anyway, I feel like I need another 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 to fully get the layers, you know how it goes when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   once and just miss out on some of the subtleties.

std::cout << What am I doing? << std::endl;

But yeah, totally worth the 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩. Can't believe it’s got me feeling things this late at night. Gonna regret this when I try to get up tomorrow, def should’ve hit the hay early tonight, but whatever. Let’s just say, that love ain’t so dark after all—or is it? Who even knows?
